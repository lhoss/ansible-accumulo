## Initially I added below 2 tasks for the functionality that seemed to be a 'failover' try using cron.
## To use it, uncomment (note: that the task includes existed already, but not below 2 tasks):
- include: cron_failover_accumulo_leader.yml
  when: accumulo_cron_failover and  accumulo_leader == True
  tags: cron_failover

- include: cron_failover_accumulo_follower.yml
  when: accumulo_cron_failover and  accumulo_leader == False
  tags: cron_failover

##Note: was not required to have even the conf/slaves file, see: http://accumulo.apache.org/1.6/accumulo_user_manual.html#_cluster_specification
